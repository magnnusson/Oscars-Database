# Oscars-Database
Project practicing use of data structures in C++ in order to create a simple database of academy awards and their information.

My database is working as intended for every function as far as I've tested. Sometimes using the exact search for the 'year' field on the movie tree does not seem to bring up any movie despite the year existing for a movie. (e.g. entering 2012 and 'Argo' does not show up as a result, like it should). I'm not sure if this is caused by using some previous function before using the complete search, but it is something to weary of. This does not happen when using the exact search as your first menu item, for instance, meaning the function does work. Otherwise, every function works perfectly.

Also, make sure to use menu items 1 and 2 first in order to read in the .csv files into the trees for all other functions to work!
